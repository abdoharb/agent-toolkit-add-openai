# Cross-file invariants: does every copy that must carry a load-bearing rule
# still carry it?
#
# This toolkit deliberately keeps several hand-synced surfaces — the lead's
# flow exists three times (the generated slash command, SYSTEM.md for an
# any-tool lead, and the generator skill's flow example), the state-file
# contract twice, and the role prose once per tool. AGENTS.md's Conventions
# say to re-diff them by hand after any pipeline change. That instruction is
# correct and it does not work: it depends on the author remembering a
# five-bullet rule at exactly the moment they are focused on something else.
# Two rules went missing on two consecutive commits before this test existed
# (a "split a very large task" rule that reached only 2 of 3 flow copies, and
# state-file fields that reached only 1 of 2 template copies).
#
# So this checks *presence*, not text equality. It cannot catch wording
# drift, and does not try to — the failure mode that actually happens is
# omission: a rule added to one copy and forgotten in the others. One grep
# per (rule, file) pair, no LLM call, and adding a rule costs one line in
# the table below.
#
# Usage: bash test/invariants.sh
# Exit 0 = every rule present everywhere it must be.
# Exit 1 = the missing (rule, file) pairs, one per line.
