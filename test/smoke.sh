# Automated version of the manual smoke run documented in CLAUDE.md's
# "Commands" section. Asserts the scaffolder's core guarantees end to end:
#
#   1. first scaffold writes every file, with no unsubstituted placeholder
#   2. the first-run customization marker is dropped exactly once
#   3. a flag-free second run loads its stamp, skips everything (never
#      clobbers), and does NOT re-drop the marker once deleted
#   3a. a flag-free plain run installs files added by a newer toolkit
#   3a. Codex lead instructions, skills, and planner are scaffolded; team.sh
#       falls back to Codex when Claude is unavailable
#   4. --update against an unchanged target reports every file up to date
#      and writes nothing
#   5. --update against a drifted file reports exactly that one diff
#   6. init.sh refuses to scaffold into its own checkout
#   7. verify-state.sh: valid state file passes; 'blocked' Status is known;
#      a third review pass (loop-cap breach) fails loudly; a blown budget
#      counter fails; 'done' is refused while an acceptance criterion is
#      unticked and unwaived, or while a ticked ledger row cites no
#      evidence; a task past review with no filled verdict fails
#   8. verify-spec.sh: the raw template fails (it is boilerplate), a filled
#      spec passes, and an unmeasurable acceptance criterion is caught
#   9. promote-findings.sh: copies findings into docs, is idempotent, and
#      refuses doc paths that escape the repo
#
# Zero dependencies beyond bash/sed/awk/diff — same stance as init.sh.
# Run directly: bash test/smoke.sh
