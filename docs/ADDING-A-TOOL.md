# Adding or moving an agent to a new tool

This is a recipe, meant to be followed on request — by an AI asked to "add
Cursor support" or "move the tester to tool X", or by a human doing it by
hand. It is not standing architecture: this toolkit keeps each role's file
self-contained per tool by default (see README's "Design decisions" for
why a shared-file version of this was tried and reverted). Reach for the
extraction step at the bottom only once a role is actually needed by a
second or third tool — not before.

## Case 1 — a role this toolkit already has, running under a tool it
doesn't support yet

Example: `tester` exists only for OpenCode (`.opencode/agents/tester.md`);
you want it to also run under some other tool.

1. **Learn the new tool's own agent/rule format first** — don't guess it.
   Find: where it looks for custom agent/rule definitions (a directory
   convention, like `.claude/agents/` or `.opencode/agents/`), what
   frontmatter or config keys it reads (model selection, a permission or
   capability model, a system-prompt field), and how — or whether — it can
   be dispatched non-interactively from a script (OpenCode has `opencode
   run --attach`; Claude Code subagents are dispatched via the `Agent`/Task
   tool from a lead session; a given third tool might only support an
   interactive UI, in which case it cannot be a `scripts/oc.sh`-style
   pipeline participant at all — say so rather than forcing the fit).
2. **Copy the existing single-tool file's actual prose**, not its
   frontmatter — job description, hard rules, working rhythm, report
   format. Adapt only what's genuinely tool-specific: the non-interactive
   framing (why there's no human to ask mid-run, if that's even true for
   this tool), the permission/capability syntax, any tool-specific
   quirk worth a line (e.g. OpenCode's `question: deny` needing an explicit
   note that it means literally no channel to ask through).
3. **Write the new tool's frontmatter for real**, in its own required
   shape — don't invent a plausible-looking schema. If the tool has a
   narrower or wider permission model than the ones already here, that
   difference is real and should show up as a real difference in what this
   role is trusted to do under that tool, not be smoothed over.
4. **Add it to the scaffolder**: put the new file under
   `templates/<tool>/...` with `__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens matching the
   existing convention (`__PROJECT_NAME__`, `__CLAUDE_MODEL__`, etc. — add
   a new one to `bin/init.sh`'s `render()` substitution list if this tool
   needs a model flag `init.sh` doesn't already take), then add a `render`
   line for it in `bin/init.sh`.
5. **If the new tool needs its own dispatch mechanism** (the way OpenCode
   needs `scripts/oc.sh`), write and template it the same way — see
   `templates/scripts/oc.sh.tmpl` for the shape (session reuse, `--text`
   to avoid inlining raw event streams, exit-code handling for usage-cap
   errors). `feature.md.tmpl`'s pipeline steps call whichever dispatch
   mechanism a given role's tool needs; add the new one there too,
   following the existing `builder`/`senior-dev` two-option pattern in
   step 2.
6. **Update README**: the file tree, the role-permissions table, and the
   "How it flows" diagrams if a genuinely new path through the pipeline
   was added (not just a new implementer vendor, which the existing
   diagram already generalizes over).
7. **Add the role's rules to `test/invariants.sh`.** That test checks one
   grep per (rule, file) pair across every copy that must carry a rule — a
   new role file is a new column for the rules it has to carry (the loop
   budgets, the ledger's write-ownership, the blocked-status protocol, and
   whichever else apply to that role). One line per rule in its table. Skip
   this and the new file silently drifts from its siblings, which is the
   exact failure the test exists to stop.
8. **Smoke-test**: run `bash test/smoke.sh` and `bash test/invariants.sh`,
   then re-run `bin/init.sh` into a scratch directory and confirm the new
   file renders with no leftover `__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens.

## Case 2 — a role that's now genuinely duplicated across 2+ tools

Only once Case 1 has actually happened twice for the same role (not in
anticipation of it): consider collapsing the now-duplicated prose into one
shared file, so a future behavioral fix is one edit instead of N.

1. Extract the actual instructions — not the frontmatter — into
   `.pipeline/roles/<role>.md` (rendered from a new
   `templates/agents-state/roles/<role>.md.tmpl`), written generically: no
   tool name in the prose itself, since two or more tools now read it.
2. Shrink every existing tool-specific file for that role down to: its own
   real frontmatter/permission block (this can never be shared — it's the
   one thing that's genuinely different per tool), a short paragraph on
   what's tool-specific about running this role under this tool, and one
   line: "Read `.pipeline/roles/<role>.md` now, in full, before doing
   anything else."
3. Add the new canonical file's `render` line to `bin/init.sh`.
4. Update README to note the exception — this toolkit's default is one
   self-contained file per tool; a role that hits this step is the
   exception, and the exception should be visible, not silent.

## Note: adding an AI tool as the *lead*, not a worker role

Everything above is about porting a worker role (planner/implementer/
reviewer/tester) to a new tool, dispatched by an existing lead. If you want
a *different* AI to be the lead itself — the orchestrator, not a dispatched
role — that's not this recipe. See [`SYSTEM.md`](../SYSTEM.md) at the repo
root: a single tool-agnostic file meant to be handed directly to that AI
("recreate this system, with yourself as the lead"), rather than something
this toolkit generates for it the way `bin/init.sh` generates worker-role
shims.

Claude and Codex lead adapters are already generated by `init.sh`; the recipe
above applies to additional runtimes. Keep one canonical workflow and adapt
dispatch, exact-session recovery, protected paths, and runtime approval using
the new tool's actual capabilities. See [Codex lead operation](CODEX.md) for
the existing integration and verification boundary.

**The tradeoff, stated plainly, so it's a real decision and not a reflex:**
an extra file read before the role can do anything, and content that's
genuinely tool-specific (not all of it) has to be judgment-called into
either the shim or the shared file — get that split wrong and you end up
re-litigating "why doesn't this line apply to me" the way this toolkit's
own `senior-dev`/`builder` split briefly did over skill access. If a role
only ever ends up needing one tool, this step was never worth taking for
it — that's normal, not a gap to preemptively fix.
