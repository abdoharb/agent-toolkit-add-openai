# Keeping a scaffolded project up to date with this toolkit

`bin/init.sh --update` already does the mechanical half: render the
current templates, `diff -u` each one against the live file in the target,
write nothing. What is missing is everything *around* it — which is why
downstream projects drift and stay drifted.

This is the plan to close that, in five stages. Stages 1–2 are the ones
worth doing first; each stage is useful on its own and none blocks the
next.

## What is broken today, precisely

Run `--update` against a project scaffolded three months ago and you hit
four problems in a row:

1. **You must remember the original flags.** Pass a different
   `--builder-model` than the original init and every substituted line in
   every file shows up as diff noise. Nothing recorded what was used.
2. **No baseline.** There is no record of *which version* of the toolkit
   the project was scaffolded from, so "what changed since I took this"
   is unanswerable — you get a diff against your local edits, which
   conflates upstream changes with your own customizations.
3. **No signal.** Twelve files of raw `diff -u` with no indication that
   one hunk is a permission-block change you must merge today and another
   is a typo fix in a comment. Every upstream change looks equally
   urgent, so none of them get merged.
4. **No migrations.** When the state-file contract gains a field or a
   section — as it has now, substantially (the acceptance-criteria ledger,
   three budget counters, a split blocked status) — existing
   `.agents/T-*.md` files in flight silently lack it, and nothing says so.
   Stage 4 below now carries the real migration note for that change.

Consequence: `--update` is technically correct and practically unused. A
project scaffolds once and never upgrades, which means every hardening
lesson this toolkit earns after the scaffold date stays upstream.

---

## Stage 1 — Stamp provenance at scaffold time

**The single highest-value change.** `init.sh` writes, on a real scaffold:

```
.agents/.toolkit-version
```

```
toolkit_sha:   79f0e14
toolkit_tag:   v0.2.0
scaffolded:    2026-08-26
project_name:  my-project
codex_sol_model: gpt-5.6-sol
codex_terra_model: gpt-5.6-terra
builder_model: hcnsec/kimi-k2.7-code
reviewer_model: hcnsec/glm-5.2
tester_model:  hcnsec/deepseek-v4-flash
test_dir:      e2e
```

Then:

- **`--update` defaults every flag from this file.** `bin/init.sh --update
  --target .` becomes the whole command. Problem 1 disappears, and with it
  the diff noise that makes the output unreadable.
- **`--update` prints the baseline** — "scaffolded from `79f0e14`
  (2026-08-26); toolkit is now at `a1b2c3d` (14 commits ahead)". Problem 2
  disappears.
- A successful merge updates the stamp; `--update` alone never writes it.
- It is committed (unlike `.agents/.oc-port`) — it describes the project,
  not the laptop.

Follow the existing conventions: written only when `FRESH_SCAFFOLD` was
true before any `render()` ran, same ordering rule as
`.needs-customization`; never written by `--update`. Add one smoke case.

**Cost:** ~30 lines in `init.sh`, one smoke case.

## Stage 2 — Version the toolkit and classify every change

There are currently **zero git tags**. Downstream has nothing to pin to.

**Tag releases**, with the version number meaning something specific to
this toolkit rather than to code:

| Bump | Means | Downstream obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAJOR** | The state-file contract, a role's authority, or a script's interface changed | Must merge deliberately; may need a migration (Stage 4) |
| **MINOR** | New template, script, flag, or role rule | Should merge at the next task boundary |
| **PATCH** | Prose, docs, comments, formatting | Merge whenever, or never |

**`CHANGELOG.md`, with an impact tag per entry** — this is what makes a
diff triage-able:

```markdown
## v0.3.0 — 2026-09-xx
- `[contract]`  state file: added *Reviewer for this task* / *Tester for
                this task*. Migration: 03-reviewer-tester-fields.md
- `[safety]`    builder: removed blanket `git *: allow`; enumerated
                read-only git verbs. Merge this one now.
- `[process]`   feature.md: ask before splitting a very large task
- `[docs]`      README: quick-start blocks merged
```

Four tags, in descending order of "drop what you are doing":
`contract` › `safety` › `process` › `docs`. A downstream operator (or
their AI lead) reads the changelog *first* and the diffs second — which
inverts today's experience, where the diff is all you get.

**Cost:** a file plus the discipline to append to it. It is the same
"write down why" discipline the toolkit already applies everywhere else.

## Stage 3 — Make `--update` a triage tool, not a diff dump

With Stages 1–2 in place, `--update` gets three cheap upgrades:

- **Summary first.** List changed files with their changelog impact tag
  before printing any hunks:

  ```
  init.sh: 3 of 12 files differ from toolkit v0.3.0 (you are on v0.2.0)
    [safety]   .opencode/agent/builder.md      — permission block
    [contract] .agents/TEMPLATE.md             — 2 new fields
    [docs]     scripts/team.sh                 — comment only
  run with --diff to see hunks, or --diff <path> for one file
  ```
- **`--only <path>`** to diff one file, so merging can be done one file at
  a time rather than all-or-nothing.
- **Meaningful exit codes:** `0` clean, `1` drift. That is all a
  downstream project needs to run `init.sh --update` in its own CI weekly
  (or in `/loop`) and open an issue when the toolkit moves — the
  difference between pull-when-you-remember and being told.

**Cost:** ~40 lines, all in the existing `render()` update branch.

## Stage 4 — Migrations for contract changes

Only `[contract]` changes need this, which is rare by design. Ship a note
per contract change under `migrations/`. **There is now a real one to
write** — the delivery-contract work applied from `REVIEW-2.md` changed the
state file more than anything since the toolkit was extracted:

```markdown
# 01 — Delivery contract (ledger, budgets, split blocked status)
Applies to: .agents/TEMPLATE.md, scripts/verify-state.sh, every role file,
            and any in-flight .agents/T-*.md

New header fields (add under **Implementer for this task:**):
  **Reviewer for this task:** / **Tester for this task:**
  **Test-fix loops:** 0 / 2      **Spec bounces:** 0 / 1
  **Blocked since:** —

New section, under Acceptance criteria:
  ### Acceptance criteria ledger — one row per AC, columns:
  | AC | Met? | Reviewer evidence | Test evidence |

Status enum: `blocked` split into `blocked:question` / `blocked:spec`.
  Bare `blocked` still validates — it is kept as the legacy value precisely
  so in-flight files don't break. Nothing to do for existing tasks.

New script: scripts/verify-spec.sh (run at the end of step 1).

Safe to skip for tasks already at Status `done`.
```

**Backward compatibility, deliberately:** the new `verify-state.sh` treats
every new field as optional — an absent budget counter is skipped rather
than failed, an absent ledger means the done-gate has nothing to check, and
bare `blocked` still validates. So a downstream project can take the new
script before it takes the new template, and its in-flight tasks keep
passing. What it does *not* get until it takes the template is the
guarantee: no ledger means nothing refuses a premature `done`. That is the
difference between the checks being installed and the checks being load-
bearing, and it is worth saying out loud in the changelog entry.

Short, literal, and hand-appliable. Do **not** build a migration runner —
these are two-line edits a few times a year, and a runner is exactly the
kind of machinery this toolkit is right to refuse. The value is the note
existing at all, so an in-flight task does not silently lack a field that
`verify-state.sh` will later check for.

## Stage 5 — A `$toolkit-update` skill in the target project

The AI-assisted merge path the README already gestures at ("hand the diff
to your AI lead and ask it to reconcile"), made into a real, templated
skill rendered by `init.sh` alongside the `$feature` skill:

1. Read `.agents/.toolkit-version` for the baseline.
2. Run `bin/init.sh --update` (flags come from the stamp).
3. Read the toolkit's `CHANGELOG.md` for entries after the baseline.
4. Work the diffs **in impact order** — `contract`, then `safety`, then
   `process`, then `docs`.
5. For each: show the user what changed upstream, what this project
   customized locally, and the proposed merge. **Never silently
   overwrite a local customization** — that is the whole reason
   `render()` is skip-if-exists.
6. **Hard stop on permission blocks.** Any hunk touching a `permission:`
   or `tools:` block is presented, never auto-applied, and carries the
   toolkit's standing rule: verify it live against the real server before
   trusting it.
   Treat a new or changed structural script (`verify-state.sh`,
   `verify-spec.sh`, `promote-findings.sh`) as `[safety]` too: these are
   what the pipeline's guarantees actually rest on, and a project running
   an old `verify-state.sh` against a new template silently loses the
   done-gate rather than failing loudly about it. This toolkit's own history is the argument — a
   blanket-deny that read correctly and did not enforce.
7. Update the stamp to the new SHA/tag when the merge is accepted.
8. Report merged / skipped / deferred, and record it in the project's
   Decisions log.

Run it **at a task boundary, never mid-task** — the state file contract is
live while a task is in flight, and changing the template under a running
task is exactly how an in-flight `T-<id>` ends up half on each contract.

---

## Upstream's own half of this

A downstream project can only merge what upstream shipped coherently. This
toolkit keeps several hand-synced copies of the same rules (three of the
lead's flow, two of the state-file contract), and hand-syncing failed twice
on consecutive commits before `test/invariants.sh` existed to check it —
including one rule that a review file recorded as applied and that was not
actually in the file.

That test is the upstream-side counterpart to everything above: it asserts
one grep per (rule, file) pair and runs in CI, so a release cannot ship a
rule that reached only two of its three homes. Add a rule to a flow copy and
you add one line to its table in the same commit. Without that, a downstream
project merging faithfully still inherits whichever copy happened to be
stale.

## Rejected: submodule or subtree

Considered and deliberately not recommended.

A git submodule or subtree would make updates trivial (`git pull`) — and
would break the property the whole design rests on: **every generated file
is meant to be edited locally.** Projects are expected to widen the
reviewer's permission block after verifying it live, fill role files with
their own project-specific pitfalls, and add steps to `feature.md`. A
submodule makes those edits either impossible or upstream-hostile.

Copy-with-provenance is the correct model for generated-then-customized
files. What is missing is not a different distribution mechanism — it is
the provenance stamp and the changelog that make merging a copy tractable.
Stages 1–2 supply exactly that.

## Recommended cadence for a downstream project

| When | Do |
| --- | --- |
| Weekly, in CI or a `/loop` | `bin/init.sh --update --target .` — exit 1 means the toolkit moved |
| On a `[safety]` entry | Merge at the next task boundary, verify permission changes live |
| On a `[contract]` entry | Merge before starting the next task; apply the migration to in-flight state files |
| On `[process]` / `[docs]` | Batch them; merge whenever convenient |
| Never | Mid-task |

## Suggested build order

Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 5 → Stage 4 as needed.

Stages 1 and 2 alone remove the two things that actually stop people from
upgrading (remembering the flags, and not knowing what matters). Stages 3
and 5 are convenience on top of a mechanism that already works. Stage 4 is
paperwork that only earns its keep when a contract change actually ships.
