# Lessons learned

Each entry below cost something to learn — a live verification, a near-miss,
or an actual incident — before it became a rule. They're written generalized
(not OpenCode-specific) so they apply to whatever tool ends up dispatched.
When you port one of these into a generated file, port the *mechanism and
the reason*, not any tool-specific flag name that happens to appear here as
the worked example.

## 1. A "wide auto-approve" flag is opt-in per task, never a standing default

Many non-interactive CLI tools have some flag that auto-approves anything
not explicitly denied, instead of hanging forever on a permission prompt
nothing can answer (OpenCode's `--auto` is the worked example this toolkit
verified live). That flag is genuinely useful — it's what ends the
"dispatch hangs on an un-allowlisted command, someone notices, widens the
allowlist, retries" cycle — but it is also, by the tool's own admission
usually, "dangerous."

- Default is off.
- Turning it on for a task is the **user's** call, asked explicitly, bundled
  into whatever approval gate already exists (don't invent a second
  interruption point for it) — never the lead's or implementer's own
  judgement call, not even after a timeout.
- **A very large task compounds this risk rather than just scaling it** — a
  wide, hard-to-review diff plus unattended permission approval across all
  of it, at once. Before asking about the flag on a task that looks very
  large (many files or subsystems, several unrelated acceptance criteria),
  ask the user first whether to split it into smaller tasks run through the
  pipeline one at a time, or proceed as a single task. Same judgement call
  as above: the lead sizes it, the user decides.
- **Verify live, before trusting it, that the tool's own explicit deny-list
  still blocks even with the flag on.** Don't take the tool's docs' word for
  it. The verification this toolkit did: dispatch a throwaway agent with a
  deny-listed command, turn the auto-approve flag on, confirm the call is
  still refused and the refusal names the specific deny rule. If a tool's
  auto-approve flag turns out to bypass its own deny-list too, that's a
  materially different (and worse) risk profile than what's described
  above — find out before recommending it, not after.
- Record which tasks had it on, and why, in the state file — not just in
  the dispatch command.

## 2. A killed dispatch may not be a finished dispatch — check before reusing its session

If the dispatched tool has any concept of a server-side session/turn that
outlives the CLI client process (OpenCode's `--attach` sessions are the
worked example), then killing the *client* does not necessarily cancel the
*turn*. A killed-but-not-cancelled turn can leave an orphaned
in-progress message with no completion marker — and reusing that session
for the next call risks two calls racing on it, which is a real, previously
observed failure mode (two writes racing on the same session produced a
collision that looked like an unrelated server error).

- Bound every dispatch with a hard wall-clock timeout.
- On a timeout **your own wrapper caused**, actively cancel the server-side
  turn if the tool exposes a way to (an abort/cancel endpoint or command),
  using whatever session id the wrapper can determine — verify this live:
  confirm the cancelled turn actually shows as completed/aborted afterward,
  don't just assume the cancel call succeeding means the turn stopped.
  Once verified, retrying the same session immediately is safe.
- On a dispatch that was killed **some other way** — interrupted by hand,
  the host process manager stopped it, the machine slept — the same
  orphaned-turn risk applies but your wrapper's own auto-cancel-on-timeout
  logic never ran. Check the session's actual state (or just cancel it
  unconditionally, if that's cheap and idempotent) before reusing it. Don't
  assume "it's not running anymore because nothing is polling it" —
  verify, the way this toolkit verified via the tool's own session-state
  API: fetch the last message, confirm it either completed normally or
  show it explicitly aborted, before sending the next one into that
  session.

## 3. Don't assume a CLI streams its own output incrementally — verify before building anything that depends on it

An idle/no-output watchdog (kill a dispatch if its output file hasn't grown
in N seconds, on the theory that "no output" means "stuck") is an
attractive-looking hardening pattern. It is **only safe if the underlying
tool actually flushes output incrementally as it works.** This toolkit
built one, tested it against a synthetic harness (passed), then tested it
against the *real* installed tool doing genuinely long, successfully
progressing work — and found the tool's own CLI batches all output until
the entire turn completes, even with an explicit line-buffered format flag
and OS-level `stdbuf` forcing. The output file sat at zero bytes through
over a dozen seconds of real, correct work. Deploying the watchdog as
designed would have killed every long-but-successful run, which is strictly
worse than the flat timeout it was meant to improve on.

- If you're about to build anything whose correctness depends on "this
  tool streams output as it goes," check that assumption against the
  actual installed version of that tool, with genuinely long real work, not
  a quick synthetic test — synthetic tests can pass on the logic while the
  underlying I/O assumption is still wrong.
- If it turns out not to stream incrementally, a flat timeout (bounded,
  simple, no false-positive risk) is the better and current design — say so
  plainly rather than shipping the fancier mechanism anyway.
- If you do find a tool that streams incrementally and want to build an
  idle-watchdog for it, re-verify against that tool's actual version before
  reusing this note as precedent — the finding above is tool-and-version
  specific, not a general property of CLI tools.

**Update 2026-09-10 — an idle watchdog now ships, on a different signal.**
The output-file-growth signal above is still dead (re-confirmed on opencode
1.18.25). But `oc.sh` no longer needs it: it polls the tool's own
**session-state API** — `GET /session/<id>/message?limit=1`, whose
byte-fingerprint tracks sub-turn progress and carries the `completed`
flag — the same API §2 already trusts for abort verification. Verified
against opencode 1.18.25 with a real multi-minute run (not false-killed) and
a forced stall (caught). `OC_TIMEOUT` is now the ceiling, `OC_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
(default 600 s) the wedge detector. Full write-up + test procedure:
`docs/OC-TIMEOUT-WATCHDOG.md`. The "flat timeout is the current design"
conclusion above held only while every candidate signal was broken — one
wasn't.

## 4. Implementer testing: scoped to fast/deterministic, not banned, not unlimited

Don't swing to either extreme:

- **Not a full ban.** A deterministic local check (a type check, a linter,
  a test suite that runs in seconds) is cheap — CPU-seconds, not a paid
  LLM call — and catching an obvious break before it ever reaches the
  reviewer/tester saves a whole loop. Banning it outright optimizes for the
  wrong cost.
- **Not unlimited either.** Slow, environment-heavy suites (full e2e,
  integration against real external services) are the dedicated tester
  role's job, run once, independently, as the record the state file
  trusts. The implementer's own local run is informational — it does not
  replace the tester's run, and should say so explicitly in its own report
  rather than implying its self-check is the verified result.
- The actual distinction driving this: avoiding a second *paid agent
  call* re-verifying what the first one already claimed is the thing worth
  being economical about (per this skill's "verification is a script, not
  a sixth agent" principle) — a second **script run** is not that, and
  reasoning about the two as if they were the same cost is how this rule
  gets over-tightened into a full ban that then has to be walked back.

## 5. Not every reviewer finding is worth a full implementer loop

`CHANGES_REQUESTED` is the default routing back to the implementer — but a
finding that names no concrete code defect (e.g. "I can't confirm this
platform API is supported on the actual target from the docs I checked,
verify before shipping") isn't something a code change can address. Sending
it back anyway burns a review-loop slot on a call the implementer has no
action for.

- If a finding is genuinely non-actionable as a code change, route it to
  wherever it *can* be resolved instead (usually: the test/verification
  step, as an explicit thing to check against the real target) — but do
  this transparently, logged in the state file with the reasoning, not by
  silently downgrading the verdict. The user should be able to see and
  disagree with the call.
- This is a judgment call the lead makes on the evidence in hand, not a
  license to wave away a finding that's inconvenient — the bar is "no code
  change could address this," not "this seems minor."

## 6. Check for a real test harness before assuming only manual verification is possible

"No browser/runtime on `PATH`" is not the same as "no way to drive a real
instance of the target." A project may already have a managed/bundled
runtime (a test framework's own downloaded browser binaries, a container
image, a local emulator) that a plain `which <tool>` check won't find,
because it isn't meant to be found that way — and the project may already
have a *working* automated-testing convention for exactly this (an existing
`e2e/` directory, a CI config, a documented manual-checklist policy) that a
fresh dispatch, working from a narrower prompt, won't discover on its own.
Before concluding "this needs the user's own hands," check: does this
project already have automated infrastructure for driving the real target,
and does the current task's verification need actually fit what that
infrastructure can reach? If yes, use it — a real automated check against
the actual artifact is stronger evidence than asking a human to click
through the same thing by hand, and is worth the extra effort to wire up
correctly (get the exact selectors/shape right by reading the actual
generated UI/output, not by guessing).

## 7. Non-destructive scaffolding, with a path to reconcile later

Never silently overwrite a file the user or a prior run may have
customized. Skip-if-exists is the safe default for first generation; for a
later re-run against a project that's drifted from what this pipeline would
now generate, offer a diff-only mode — render the current version to a
temp location, `diff -u` against the live file, write nothing — so the
human (or an agent working with the human) can merge deliberately instead
of either blindly overwriting or blindly staying stale forever.

## 8. First-run, project-specific customization: ask once, then never again

A freshly generated pipeline's role/flow files start out generic — they
don't yet know this project's own sharp edges (a hard rule that isn't in
the root guidance file yet, a permission boundary worth calling out
explicitly). Rather than leaving that gap open indefinitely or re-asking
every run, gate a single customization prompt behind a marker written only
on first generation (never on a later re-run/update) and cleared only once
the human answers it. This keeps the ask-once property without needing
anything heavier than a marker file.

## 9. "Receipt not record" applies role-to-role — and is worth extending to the lead's own report, deliberately, not by default

Every worker role's reply to the lead should be short: a verdict line, a
pass/fail count, the one-line handoff field — never a second copy of what
it already wrote to the state file. This is settled and load-bearing (see
`reference/flow-example.md`).

Whether the **lead's own report to the human** should get the same
compression is a live, unresolved question this toolkit has raised but not
settled — the human is not re-reading a state file the way the next role
is, so some of the state file's content genuinely needs to reach them
somewhere, and over-compressing that report risks hiding the "blocked,
unverified, or needs a decision" signal the human actually needs to act on.
If you're generating a lead flow and asked to tighten its human-facing
report, treat this as a real design decision to make with the user, not an
obvious extension of the role-to-role rule — get their answer on what to
keep versus compress before changing it.

## 10. In a permission map, prefer enumerated-safe over broad-allow-with-narrow-denies

A permission map shaped like `"tool *": allow` plus specific
`"tool dangerous*": deny` exceptions only blocks the dangerous calls if
the runtime resolves narrow rules over broad ones — first-match,
most-specific-match, and last-match-wins are all real designs, and a map
that reads correctly under one precedence rule silently fails under
another. This is the same class of assumption as verifying permission
enforcement live, but at the within-one-map level: even a runtime that
enforces *some* deterministic ordering can enforce a different one than
the file's visual order implies.

- Prefer enumerating the safe commands explicitly (the read-only verbs
  the role's rhythm actually needs) and letting everything else fall
  through to "ask" or the tool's equivalent. The safe path then never
  depends on precedence at all — there is no broad allow for a narrow
  deny to outrank.
- Keep the explicit denies anyway, even when they look redundant under
  the "ask" catch-all: wide auto-approve flags (entry 1) typically
  bypass "ask"-level entries while still honoring explicit denies, so
  the denies are what holds with the flag on.
- If a role genuinely needs broad access plus exceptions, that is a
  live-verification requirement, not a config detail: dispatch it, make
  it try the denied thing, confirm the refusal names the deny rule.

## 11. Anything a script writes from agent-authored content gets its paths treated as untrusted

When a deterministic script copies or writes to a path that originated in
agent-written state (a findings line naming a doc, an output location a
role chose), that path is untrusted input even with no adversary in the
loop — a confused agent is enough. `../..` segments or absolute paths let
a well-meaning finding write outside the repo, defeating whatever
write-scoping the pipeline set up everywhere else.

- Refuse absolute paths and any `..` path segment; skip loudly rather
  than silently normalizing.
- Anchor the script itself to the repo root (the way dispatch wrappers
  do) so relative paths have exactly one meaning no matter the caller's
  CWD.

## 12. A contract nobody closes is a pipeline that can't say what it delivered

Acceptance criteria are the whole point of the spec — and it is startlingly
easy to build a pipeline where **nobody ever records whether one was met.**
This toolkit shipped exactly that: the planner wrote criteria as checkboxes,
one rule said no other role may edit them, no role was told to tick one, the
tester never read them, and the final report asked the lead for "criteria met
versus outstanding" with no artifact behind that answer. Every role did its
job and the contract still never closed.

- Give the criteria a **ledger**: one row each, with the reviewer's citation
  (`file:line`) and the tester's (which test) in **separate** columns.
- **Split ownership of text and outcome.** The planner owns the criterion's
  wording and may not record outcomes; the lead owns the outcome and writes
  nothing but what the reviewer and tester already put in the file; the
  implementer may never mark its own work met.
- **A tick requires both evidence cells.** No evidence, no tick —
  "unverified" is a true, useful answer, and a tick that hides it is the
  exact failure this prevents.
- Have the structural check **refuse the terminal status** while any
  criterion is unticked and unwaived. That single check is the difference
  between a pipeline that produces work and one that can tell you what it
  produced.

## 13. Every status needs exactly one owner, or the field rots silently

A status enum is cheap to write and easy to leave half-wired. This toolkit
shipped **eight** status values of which only **three** were ever set by any
role — including the terminal `done`, which nothing set at all, while a
separate status-board rule said "only check off a task once its status
reaches done." That rule could never fire. Worse, the two implementers
disagreed: one set a blocked status on an open question, the other just
stopped, so the same event left the ledger in two different states depending
on which vendor ran.

- Write a **transition table** into the state-file template itself: status,
  who sets it, on what event. One row per value, no exceptions.
- Then check the obvious consistencies in the structural script (test
  results present ⇒ status is at least "testing"; terminal status ⇒ the
  contract is closed). Cheap greps, and they catch the drift that makes
  every downstream reader — board, script, human — inherit a stale value.
- **Duplicated roles must transition identically.** If two tools run "the
  same role," diff their instructions for status handling specifically; it
  is the first thing to diverge and the last thing anyone notices.

## 14. Budget every path back to the implementer, not just the one you thought of

A review-loop cap is the obvious anti-thrash rule and most designs have it.
The paths that get forgotten are the other ways the same implementer gets
re-engaged: **test failures** (fix → test → fail → fix …) and **spec
defects**. This toolkit capped review loops structurally — a script failed
loudly on a third review pass — while test failures routed back "as a new
loop" with no cap, no counter, and no check. A flaky suite plus an eager
implementer could cycle forever and nothing in the system would notice,
because the only budget in the file counted review passes.

- Enumerate **every** edge that re-engages the implementer and give each one
  a counter in the state file, with the cap written next to the count
  (`0 / 2`) so the reader needs no outside knowledge.
- Have the structural script parse and enforce them. A budget with nothing
  counting it is not a budget, it is a sentence in a document.
- Blowing a budget is an **escalation to the human**, never a reason to keep
  looping — two failed laps means the spec is wrong, the suite is wrong, or
  the environment is, and none of those are fixed by a third lap.

## 15. Give a bad spec a way back to the planner, not only up to the human

If the implementer's only options are "comply" or "stop the world," every
spec defect — including trivially mechanical ones — costs a human
interruption. Real teams return the ticket to whoever wrote it.

- Add a **bounce**: the implementer records concretely which criterion or
  scope line is unbuildable and why, sets a distinct blocked status, and the
  lead re-dispatches the **planner** once with that objection.
- **Cap it at one.** A second rejection is no longer a planning problem, it
  is a "we don't agree what this task is" problem, and that is the human's
  to settle.
- Keep the two blocked states distinct (waiting-on-human vs bounced-to-
  planner). One undifferentiated "blocked" cannot tell a status board — or
  tomorrow's session — which of the two it is looking at.

## 16. A stopped task needs to say what it is waiting on, and since when

"Do not proceed on silence" is the right rule at an approval gate, and it
quietly assumes the human is about to answer. When they are not — overnight,
next week — the pipeline just stops, and if the pending question lives only
in the lead's conversation, a resumed or fresh session cannot tell what the
task is parked on. The state file is the only thing that survives; the
conversation is not.

- Record **what** it waits on (prefix the open question `[human]` /
  `[planner]`) and **since when** (a dated field), in the state file and the
  status board, at the moment you stop.
- This costs one line and is the difference between a task that resumes and
  a task that silently dies at a gate nobody remembers opening.

## 17. Independence of *opinion* is not independence of *evidence*

Switching the reviewer to a different model family is a real control, and it
is the one everyone implements — this toolkit put it on its own front page.
It buys an independent **opinion** about the diff. It buys **nothing** about
the tests: if the implementer wrote them, a green run confirms only that the
code matches its author's own idea of correct. That is a weaker claim than
the pass count implies, and no reader can tell the difference unless the file
says so.

- Make the tester **read the acceptance criteria** — a suite that exercises
  none of them is not evidence, however green.
- Require an **AC → covering test → result** table, and an explicit list of
  criteria **no** test covers. An uncovered criterion is a finding, not a
  silence.
- Require a **test-authorship line** (`implementer this task` /
  `pre-existing` / `tester`). One field, and it tells every later reader how
  much the green is worth.
- Never let the tester edit a test to make it pass. If a test looks wrong,
  that is a finding for someone else to act on.

## 18. A second review pass must close the first, not restart it

A loop cap only guarantees convergence if each pass is *about* the previous
one. Nothing stops a reviewer from returning an entirely new set of findings
about untouched code on pass 2 — and when that happens the cap stops being a
convergence guarantee and becomes an arbitrary cutoff: the pipeline stops
because it ran out of loops, not because the work converged. This is the
oldest pathology in human code review (moving goalposts) and it transfers
intact.

- Require each later pass to **close every earlier finding by number**:
  fixed / withdrawn / disputed / routed elsewhere. An unmentioned finding is
  treated as withdrawn.
- Admit findings about **code the diff didn't change** on a later pass only
  at the top severities. Smaller ones go to the findings-for-docs path.
- Point the reviewer at the implementer's **decisions/reasoning log**, not
  only the diff. If the implementer is told that unwritten disagreement
  resolves against it, something must actually read what it writes —
  otherwise the disagreement channel is theatre, and the author learns to
  stop using it.
- Have the lead **write down each adjudication** (finding number, which way,
  why). An adjudication living only in the lead's context cannot be
  appealed or audited, and does not survive a compaction.

## 19. Check the spec with a script too, not just the code

Code gets review passes; the spec that every downstream role treats as the
contract typically gets one glance from the human least equipped to notice a
missing criterion, an over-wide file scope, or an empty permissions table —
because all they see is the planner's own summary of the planner's own work.

Most spec defects are **structural**, which means they are greppable and do
not need an LLM: boilerplate left unfilled, zero criteria (or more than the
role's own splitting threshold), a criterion built on an adjective
("robust", "works well", "properly") rather than an observable, an empty
scope table, a permissions table that is neither filled nor explicitly
"none", a ledger row missing for some criterion.

- Write the spec-checker as a sibling of the state-checker and run it before
  the human sees the spec. Same principle as "verification is a script, not
  a sixth agent," applied one step earlier in the pipeline.
- Keep it to **structure, never quality** — it cannot tell you a criterion is
  wrong, only that it is missing or unmeasurable on its face. Judging whether
  the spec is *right* stays the human's job at the approval gate; the script
  just guarantees they are looking at a finished spec.
- A spec defect caught here costs one planner call. The same defect caught
  after implementation costs a full implement→review loop.

## 20. The role that decides scope needs the minimalism rules most

Behavioral defaults — simplicity first, surgical changes, state assumptions,
verifiable success criteria — get inlined into the implementer, because that
is where code gets written. This toolkit did exactly that for both its
implementers and gave the **planner** none of them. But the planner decides
*what gets built at all* and *how wide the file scope is*: work never scoped
costs nothing to implement, review, or test, and removing a file from scope
during planning is free where discovering it was unnecessary in review costs
a loop.

That is a leverage inversion — the cheapest place to remove work had the
fewest rules about removing it.

- Inline the same behavioral defaults into the planner, phrased for scope
  rather than code.
- Add two fields the human reads at the approval gate: **the simplest
  version considered** (and why the spec is bigger), and **the blast
  radius** (what breaks if this is wrong). Both are things a good planner
  already reasons about; the fields make that reasoning reviewable instead
  of internal, and give the human something concrete to push back on other
  than the planner's own framing.

## 21. Session scope is one task per role

This lesson was first written the other way round — "same task → same
session for all sub-agents alike", on the theory that a fresh reviewer or
tester re-reading every file costs more than the independence is worth. It
did not hold up. On opencode v2 a session pins the tool set of the agent
that opened it: a tester dispatched into the builder's session reported
"file-edit tool is not exposed" twice and could not record its results,
while a fresh session wrote them first time. A shared session also handed
the reviewer the builder's in-session reasoning instead of just the diff.
The rule that held up: **same task and same role → same session; another
role → its own session; new task → new sessions.** Each role's id lives in
its own state-file field, and only that role's retry reuses it.

## 22. Track classifications with their decision source

Wherever the pipeline records a judgment about a task (here: its class —
routine / standard / sensitive), record **who made it**: `agent` or
`human`. A bare value decays into folklore — nobody can later tell whether
a human chose it or a model guessed. Two rules kept this cheap:

- The **model proposes** (the planner knows the spec's true breadth best),
  the lead confirms, and the human is asked **only when the lead is torn**.
  Asking on every task makes the question noise; noise trains humans to
  auto-approve.
- The classification is **recorded, not acted on**: it never changes
  session policy, permissions, or budgets mid-task. A label that can
  silently change what a role is allowed to do is a permission system, and
  permission changes belong at gates, not in metadata.

## 23. A long-lived dispatch server caches permission config

A permission deny that "is in the file" is not a deny that fires. Verified
live: an OpenCode-style server kept running for three days across edits to
the role files; agent definitions were read at startup, so newly added
deny rules never took effect — a `git push` deny silently didn't apply,
while older rules (present before startup) enforced fine. The config was
correct; the process was stale.

- After editing any dispatched agent's permission block, **restart the
  dispatch server** and re-run one negative probe before trusting it.
- A "verified live" claim has a timestamp. Config verified last month on a
  server that restarted yesterday is not verified.

## 24. Blanket bash denies do not block the runtime's built-in safe list

With `bash "*": deny` confirmed working (arbitrary commands hard-fail with
a rule error), some commands still executed: `ls`, `git status`. The
runtime treats certain known-read-only commands as always-permitted,
above any configured rule. Design accordingly:

- A blanket bash deny limits *damage*, not *observation*. Anything visible
  to `ls`/`git status` should be assumed readable by every role.
- When auditing permissions, probe with an innocuous non-safe command
  (`whoami`, `touch /tmp/...`), not with `ls` — a passing `ls` proves
  nothing about the deny actually being loaded.

## 25. A rule the template states but the checker doesn't verify is not a rule

The state-file template can say "a box may be ticked only when both
evidence cells are filled" in plain words, every role can have read it, and
the box still gets ticked on recollection — because the only thing that
actually holds a pipeline to a rule is the deterministic check, and a rule
that lives only in prose is enforced by nobody. This surfaced twice at the
same seam: a criterion marked met with an empty evidence column, and a
review verdict where the placeholder had been deleted but no verdict
written (the check only looked for the *placeholder string*, so its absence
read as "filled").

- For every load-bearing rule you write into the template, ask whether the
  structural check actually asserts it. "Ticked ⇒ both evidence cells
  non-empty" and "past review ⇒ a filled verdict on record" are both cheap
  greps; without them the template is documentation, not a contract.
- Prefer checks that catch a *positive* bad state (a tick with no
  evidence) over ones that catch a known-bad *token* (the literal
  placeholder). The token check passes the moment someone edits the
  placeholder out, which is exactly when you most need it to fire.
- Give the handoff a **machine-readable form** at every seam a script or
  the lead has to branch on. Have the reviewer open its reply with a fixed
  `VERDICT: <PASS|CHANGES_REQUESTED>` line and branch on that line — not on
  a scan of the findings prose or the raw event stream, both of which are
  parseable only by eye and only unreliably.

## 26. Instrument the pipeline's own cost, not just the product's

It is easy to end up tracking the *product's* cost to a decimal while the
*pipeline's* own $/min per role is invisible — knowable only when a
timeout forces someone to open a session and look. That is how an
expensive, slow, verdict-less reviewer model survives far longer than it
should: nothing routinely surfaces that one dispatch cost 200x another.

- Have the dispatch wrapper append one structured line per call to a log
  the pipeline owns: timestamp, role, model, session, wall-clock seconds,
  exit status, and — best-effort from the tool's own session API — token
  counts and cost. One line, one file, appended on every outcome including
  a timeout.
- Make it strictly additive and best-effort: a failure to resolve cost or
  write the line must never change the run's exit code. Telemetry that can
  break the thing it measures gets disabled the first time it does.
- Treat the log as machine state, not a committed artifact — add it to the
  target repo's ignore file the same way the wrapper's other local state
  (server port, session ids) is handled.

## 27. Re-check a tool's discovery surface before preserving an old limitation

A tool that once supported custom agents only in machine-global configuration
may later add repository-scoped agents and skills. Treating the old limitation
as permanent leaves a documented "manual adapter" long after the tool can be a
first-class project lead.

- Verify current official documentation before adding or rejecting support.
- Prefer repository-scoped instructions, skills, and agents when the tool
  discovers them; they are reviewable and travel with the project.
- Keep one canonical workflow and make tool-specific lead entry points thin
  adapters over it. Duplicating a long flow creates another hand-synced policy
  surface; an adapter should name only genuine capability differences.
- Launcher fallback should be deterministic and overridable: prefer the
  established lead when available, fall back to the supported alternative when
  it is absent, and provide an explicit selection flag for testing and intent.

## 28. A new update entry point needs a lower-level bootstrap path

A command or skill introduced by an upgrade cannot perform the upgrade that
installs itself. Existing users of another lead may already have an update
command, but users of the newly supported lead need one documented shell-level
path before its project integration exists.

- Keep preview and write separate: first show drift without writing, then run a
  skip-if-exists installer that can add only missing files.
- Persist scaffold inputs so the missing-file run does not require users to
  reconstruct old model and directory choices.
- Test the exact bootstrap state by removing the newly introduced files from a
  stamped scaffold and confirming a flag-free run restores only those files,
  preserves the stamp, and does not retrigger first-run behavior.

## 29. Keep writable handoff records outside protected instruction directories

A writable workspace can still contain recursively protected instruction,
configuration, or version-control directories. A syntactically valid worker
sandbox setting does not prove it can write the handoff there. Keep task
records, logs, and runtime markers separate from skill/config discovery, and
probe the real OS sandbox before relying on a path. Move every role and checker
together at a task boundary; retain a read-only legacy baseline and refuse
bootstrap that would silently create two runtimes.

## 30. Resume exact identities, and fail when identity cannot be recovered

The latest conversation in a repository is not the conversation associated
with a particular team. Capture the runtime's authoritative session identity,
pin it per team, and resume that exact identity. Capture through a reviewed
lifecycle event rather than guessing from timestamps or arbitrary transcript
files. A failed resume or a skipped/untrusted capture must stop for recovery;
starting fresh silently loses decisions. Keep a process lock to prevent two
leads using one pin. Worker corrections reuse the task's recorded worker thread;
record a replacement when that thread is no longer recoverable.

## 31. Workflow consent and runtime permission approval are separate controls

Approval of a spec or merge is a decision about the work. It does not remove
filesystem, network, execution-rule, or hook-trust boundaries. Check actual
state writes and authenticated worker-runtime access before dispatching. When
blocked, report the precise operation and request the narrow runtime approval
it needs, rather than disabling protection. Classify permission-sensitive
updates by behavior across every tool's schema, including hooks and TOML, not
only by the first tool's YAML field names. Configuration/skill presence is not
proof of discovery; fake-CLI tests are not live model workflow evidence.

## 32. A compatible legacy config path is not a reliable discovery contract

A runtime may document backward-compatible discovery of an old role directory
while its live agent endpoint loads only built-ins from that project. Treat the
current canonical project path as the contract for generated scaffolds, and
migrate old paths explicitly at a task boundary instead of depending on a
compatibility promise. Refuse a plain bootstrap that would create a second role
tree beside an unmigrated first one.

Likewise, configuration agreement is not runtime readiness. Before dispatch,
resolve every configured model id against the live provider and inspect the
live role list after a restart, upgrade, path migration, or permission change.
A model name written consistently in three files can still be unavailable, and
a permission file that exists on disk can still correspond to no loaded role.

## 33. A structural checker that flattens nested config lies, and a scratch copy is not the artifact

Two related traps surfaced while chasing a suspected permission-enforcement
bug: a "does this key repeat?" script written against nested config
(permission maps, frontmatter) that flattens the whole document before
comparing keys, and a scratch-dir repro built by hand-copying the real file
under test.

- **Scope every duplicate/structural check to the mapping a key actually
  lives in, never the whole document.** A key legitimately repeats across
  independent sibling sections (an `edit:` permission map and a `write:`
  map both keying `"*"`) and that is not a defect. Verified directly
  against this toolkit's own `tester.md.tmpl`: a flattened duplicate-key
  grep reported three "duplicates" that were each a pattern reused across
  two unrelated sibling maps — a false positive that would send someone
  chasing a bug that was never there.
- **A repro must be the byte-identical real artifact, not a copy made while
  diagnosing the issue.** Hand-copying or cleaning up a file in the course
  of investigating it is easy to silently "fix" in the act of copying
  (a duplicate line deduplicated, whitespace normalized) — the copy then
  passes a check the original fails, and the result is read as "verified
  safe" when nothing about the original was actually re-tested.
- Combined, these two traps can produce a fully self-consistent but wrong
  investigation: the flattening checker under-reports real defects on some
  files and over-reports on others, while a from-scratch repro built to
  confirm or deny a hypothesis quietly tests a different file than the one
  in production. Treat any safety conclusion reached through either
  shortcut as unconfirmed until re-run against the real file with a
  structure-aware check.

## 34. Direct lead support needs an adapter, not another copy of the pipeline

- A tool being able to run workers does not make it a supported lead. Supply
  its native entrypoints, a planner, approval routing, launcher/authentication,
  and reconciliation command; do not stop at a prompt that says "act as lead."
- Keep shared role policy in one canonical prompt and use thin adapters for
  tool-specific metadata, dispatch, and permission semantics. A prompt file
  named for one tool can be read by another without that tool's CLI installed.
  Read the body as instructions; do not inherit incompatible frontmatter.
- Do not resume "the latest session" when leads and workers use the same
  runtime. It can silently select a worker. Resume only a known lead id, or
  start fresh and disclose that automatic lead pinning is not implemented.
- Long dispatches should leave the lead responsive: use background execution
  and completion notifications when supported. Send literal prompts through
  files, and preserve one transcript per role/pass instead of overwriting
  earlier evidence. Runtime limitations must be disclosed, not invented away.
- Verify the served model rather than the requested label before claiming
  model-maker independence. A gateway name is not a model-maker identity, and
  shared sessions can contaminate evidence even when model families differ.
  Document the tradeoff; an adapter must not silently change session policy.
- A downstream handoff is dated operational evidence, not a new universal
  contract. Revalidate snapshots and resolve conflicts explicitly. Transfer
  generalized lessons into the source toolkit, not project paths, rosters,
  temporary quotas, or historical claims of permission safety.
- A denied edit tool is not filesystem isolation if shell can write files.
  Use least privilege, disclose the boundary, and verify resolved rules and
  refused actions against the exact generated artifact in a fresh runtime.

## 35. Hosting an existing lead is not launching or approving a pipeline

- A terminal/workspace integration must adopt a user-started lead, not require
  its own launcher or silently create a replacement conversation. Make layout,
  prompting, and process launch distinct actions; adoption can be metadata-only.
- A globally installed plugin needs runtime bindings scoped by server,
  workspace, and project. Pane ids alone are not unique across servers. Persist
  outside managed source checkouts and projects, and verify native session
  identity before focusing or prompting; do not select the latest worker.
- A host's idle/done state describes a terminal turn, not acceptance criteria.
  Display the actual task record and keep deterministic verification and
  evidence gates authoritative. Do not take lifecycle authority away from the
  host's official integration merely to relabel a pane as lead.
- Native interactive lifecycle reporting may not cover headless workers.
  Preserve dispatch receipts and state files rather than claiming the host's
  badges monitor processes it cannot identify. Empty support terminals must
  not be advertised as automatic worker routing.
- Role text is not a runtime profile or permission switch. A briefing can tell
  an existing agent how to behave; only the runtime's real profile selection
  can apply its configured permission block. Disclose that distinction.
- Treat task text as untrusted terminal output: strip control characters and
  avoid exposing external file links. Keep one-shot prompt submissions bounded
  and never retry blindly after a timeout, since input may already have arrived.
- Host action commands and terminal entrypoints may use different working
  directories. Resolve entrypoint code from the host's protected package-root
  context and pass the target project separately; test the actual manifest
  command from a target project, not only from the plugin checkout.
- A useful host dashboard should derive stage graphs, counts, and blocker
  summaries deterministically from task records, independently of the current
  model. Separate visualization from inference: unknown/blocked stages remain
  explicit, acceptance bars are recorded data rather than verification, and a
  responsive display cannot make stale source records fresh.
- Placement modes may accept different API parameters: a split needs a target
  pane while a new tab may reject it. Test placement-specific argument contracts,
  not just successful responses from a permissive fake host.
- Check the host's actual UI extension boundary before promising an embedded
  graphical panel. A terminal-only plugin host can offer colored, scrollable
  cards and graphs, but not a native webview. Preserve a plain-text fallback
  and keep navigation read-only instead of coupling display to agent actions.
- Keep record visualization callable without the workspace host. A standalone
  viewer should discover the task directory from cwd, require no host session
  context or full scaffold for reading records, and reuse the same renderer so
  the hosted and independent views cannot drift.
- Install the viewer as a self-contained project command and track it in the
  same non-destructive update triage as other generated artifacts. A generated
  launcher must not depend on the original toolkit checkout still existing;
  additive installation must preserve customization and provenance.

## 36. Lead parity is the harness, not the flow text

Two leads can read the same canonical flow and still feel very different,
because most of the friction lives in what each harness supplies around it.
Audit those mechanics directly rather than re-reading the flow:

- **Native roles on the lead's own side.** If one lead can spawn its own
  implementer and reviewer and the other can only dispatch a remote worker,
  the second has fewer options at every step. Give each lead native role
  adapters that delegate to the *same* role contract file (never a second
  copy of the rules), and make the reviewer's independence check compare the
  implementer's vendor family, whichever lead spawned it.
- **Prefer a runtime-enforced boundary where the runtime offers one.** A
  read-only sandbox for the reviewer is stronger than a permission block that
  reads correctly. Say which roles are enforced and which are disciplined.
- **Per-call approval friction is a parity gap.** A sandboxed lead that needs
  approval for every dispatch, status check and wait gets prompted dozens of
  times per run. The signal is users hand-adding the same allow rules to
  personal config. Ship a project-scoped allowlist covering only the
  toolkit's own wrappers, effective only in a trusted project, treated as a
  permission change on update, and verified live: wrappers run unprompted,
  everything else still prompts. A sandbox-testing preflight must stay
  outside that allowlist, or it stops testing the sandbox.
- **Waiting and retrying must not depend on scheduler tools.** A lead with no
  background-notify or scheduled-wakeup tool needs plain commands: a bounded
  `wait` it can call again, and a detached retry loop that reruns a dispatch
  only on a usage-limit failure (never a timeout), keeps each failed attempt
  out of the completion signal, and caps its attempts. Learn how the lead's
  exec tool handles a long command (killed at a timeout, or yielded and left
  running) before writing guidance around it.
- **Recovery should start oriented.** A session-start hook can print one line
  per unfinished task from the state files, as a pointer the resumed lead must
  still verify. Keep per-prompt hooks silent so they do not grow the lead's
  context.
