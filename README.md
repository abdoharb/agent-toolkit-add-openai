# agent-toolkit

A reusable version of the planner → implement → review → test multi-agent
pipeline: Codex subagents (Sol for planning/review and Terra for
implementation), OpenCode (any vendor) for cross-vendor
implement/review/test, a state file
(`.agents/T-<id>.md`) as the single handoff surface between roles, and a
`delegate` skill so the lead's own context stays small across a long run. 

It was distilled from real multi-agent pipeline runs and hardened there
over time, so the same setup — permissions, session-reuse policy,
cross-vendor independence rules, the state-file contract — doesn't get
re-invented and re-debugged from scratch in every new repo.

**Want a different tool to run the lead itself (not just a worker role)?**
Read `[SYSTEM.md](SYSTEM.md)` instead of this
file — one tool-agnostic page meant to be handed to any AI ("recreate this
system, with yourself as the lead"), pointing into `templates/` for detail
on demand rather than requiring everything read up front.

## How it flows

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Req([Feature request]) --> Lead
    Lead -->|dispatch| Planner
    Planner -->|T-id.md - Goal, ACs, ledger rows, scope| Spec[/verify-spec.sh<br/>structural check, no LLM call/]
    Spec -- fails --> Planner
    Spec -- passes --> Approve{User approves?}
    Approve -- no or open questions --> Req
    Approve -- yes --> Impl[Implementer<br/>builder or senior_dev]
    Impl -- spec unbuildable, max 1 bounce --> Planner
    Impl -->|code, T-id.diff, Decisions log| Review[Reviewer]
    Review -- CHANGES_REQUESTED, max 2 loops --> Impl
    Review -- PASS --> Test[Tester]
    Test -- failures, max 2 loops --> Impl
    Test -->|AC coverage, test authorship| Ledger[Lead closes the AC ledger<br/>a tick needs reviewer AND test evidence]
    Ledger --> Report[Lead reports: ACs met, unverified, loops used]
    Report --> Merge{Merge?}
```



Every arrow into or out of a role is really a write to, or a read from,
`.agents/T-<id>.md` — see below.

### Context stays small, by construction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Lead
    participant Role as Role (any)
    participant File as .agents/T-id.md

    Lead->>Role: dispatch (task id, short prompt)
    Role->>File: full detail - diff, Decisions log,<br/>verdict, test results
    Role->>File: Latest handoff (one line)
    Role-->>Lead: short reply - verdict or pass count only
    Note over Lead: reads Latest handoff,<br/>not the whole file
    Lead->>File: opens the full file only on a<br/>verify-state.sh failure or a real decision
```



A role's chat reply is a receipt, not the record — the record is always the
file. That's what keeps the lead's own context flat whether the run has one
task or twenty: it never accumulates a second copy of every diff, verdict,
and test log it dispatched.

### Role permissions at a glance


| Role                                   | Reads                  | Writes                                      | Notes                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead                                   | state file             | the acceptance-criteria ledger, Status      | the only role that records whether a criterion was met  |
| Planner                                | whole repo             | `.agents/T-<id>.md` only                    | never touches source; owns criteria *text*, not outcome |
| Implementer (`senior_dev` / `builder`) | whole repo             | source + `.agents/T-<id>.diff` + state file | the only roles that edit source                         |
| Reviewer                               | whole repo (read-only) | state file only, or nothing — see below     | blanket `edit`/`write: deny` by default in this toolkit |
| Tester                                 | whole repo (read-only) | `<test-dir>/**` + state file only           | never fixes, only reports                               |


The reviewer template ships **safer than it has to be** — blanket deny, not
scoped-allow on `.agents/**` — because a permission block that reads
correctly in YAML isn't proof it's enforced by the runtime. Loosen it only
after verifying that live against your own OpenCode server (see "Design
decisions" below).

```



## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MShokry/agent-toolkit ~/tools/agent-toolkit

cd /path/to/some/other/project
opencode models          # see what's actually configured before picking models

~/tools/agent-toolkit/bin/init.sh \
  --target . \
  --project-name "my-project" \
  --builder-model "hcnsec/auto" \
  --reviewer-model "hcnsec/Kimi-K3" \
  --tester-model "hcnsec/auto" \
  --codex-sol-model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --codex-terra-model gpt-5.6-terra \
  --test-dir e2e
```

`--reviewer-model` should be a different model family from the builder.
When that is impossible for a task, the pipeline switches to the generated
Codex Sol `reviewer_fallback` agent so review remains independent. The
`hcnsec/auto` builder value above is flag *shape* only — run `opencode
models`, pin real strings, and never use `auto` for the reviewer.

Cost/quality picks (Kimi implementer, GLM reviewer, DeepSeek Flash tester,
Codex Sol lead/planner/fallback review, and Codex Terra implementation),
and why one OpenCode aggregator plus Codex is better than a new toolkit
tool per lab: see
[`docs/MODELS.md`](docs/MODELS.md).

`init.sh` never overwrites a file that already exists in the target — it
prints `skip (exists)` and leaves it alone, so re-running is safe and an
existing project's customizations survive.

`init.sh --update` never writes anything either — it renders the current
templates into a temp file and compares each one against what's already in
`--target`, printing a drift **summary** first (`exit 0` = clean, `exit 1`
= something to merge; full hunks behind `--diff`, one file via
`--only <path>`). On any scaffold after v0.3.0, flags default from
`.agents/.toolkit-version` — the provenance stamp written at init — so
usually just `--update --target .` is needed. Merge deliberately (or run
the generated `$toolkit-update` skill and let your lead reconcile,
triaging against the impact-tagged `CHANGELOG.md`), then refresh the
baseline: `bin/init.sh --refresh-stamp --target .`. Full workflow:
[`docs/UPGRADING.md`](docs/UPGRADING.md).

### Updating a project scaffolded before v0.3.0

Older scaffolds have no `.agents/.toolkit-version` stamp. One-time
migration — in the *target* project:

`$toolkit-update` doesn't exist in the target yet at this point (step 3
below is what adds it) — so this first pass has to be done by hand,
against the *toolkit checkout*, not the target's own commands:

1. **Get the latest toolkit on disk** (this is what you update against):
   `git -C <toolkit-checkout> pull`, or
   `git clone https://github.com/MShokry/agent-toolkit` if it isn't
   cloned yet.
2. From the toolkit checkout, run
   `bin/init.sh --update --target <path-to-project>`. With no stamp it
   recovers the original init values from the target's own scaffolded
   files and prints them for you to verify — pass a flag explicitly only
   if one couldn't be recovered. This prints the drift summary and
   **doesn't write anything yet**. Before merging, check
   `.agents/T-*.md` for any `Status:` that isn't `done` — merge at a task
   boundary, not mid-flight.
3. Run the **same command again with the same flags, minus `--update`**
   (i.e. plain `bin/init.sh --target <path> --project-name ... [...]`) —
   skip-if-exists makes this safe. This is what actually adds the files
   your scaffold predates (`.agents/skills/toolkit-update/SKILL.md`,
   `scripts/verify-spec.sh`); it is **not** flag-free the way a re-run
   against an already-current project is — you still need the values from
   step 2, because this run doesn't attempt recovery itself.
4. Merge in `CHANGELOG.md` impact order. Coming from ≤ v0.2.x also apply
   `migrations/01-delivery-contract.md` to `.agents/TEMPLATE.md` and any
   in-flight `.agents/T-*.md` (bare `blocked` still validates; nothing
   breaks if you skip it — you just don't get the new guarantees).
5. Create the baseline: `bin/init.sh --refresh-stamp --target <path>`
   (same flags again).

Every later update is then just: pull the toolkit → open the target repo
→ `$toolkit-update` → done.

## Using it

The pipeline is a repository skill, not a separate program. Once scaffolded,
open Codex in the target repo and run:

```
$feature <describe the feature or bug you want fixed>
```

That loads the generated `.agents/skills/feature/SKILL.md` — the lead reads it,
dispatches `planner` first, and walks the flow in "How it flows" above.
Two things need to be true first:

- `opencode serve` must be reachable — `scripts/team.sh` starts it in a
tmux layout (and resumes the lead's own conversation by default — see
[`docs/TEAM.md`](docs/TEAM.md) for that and for running a second project
at the same time), or run `opencode serve` yourself. `$feature`'s own
Preflight step checks this (`curl -sS -m 5 http://localhost:4096`) and
tells you to start it if it isn't running.
- The target project needs its own `AGENTS.md`. Every
generated role file defers project-specific constraints to it (see
"Design decisions" below) — without one, a role has nothing binding it
beyond this toolkit's generic rules.

Read `skills/toolkit-init/SKILL.md`'s "After it runs" checklist before
trusting the loop unattended, in particular the reviewer's permission
block — verify it's actually enforced against your real OpenCode server,
not just correct-looking YAML.

The first `$feature` run on a freshly-scaffolded project also asks, once,
whether to fill the generated role files' generic "what this codebase will
punish you for" sections with real specifics from your actual codebase —
gated by a `.agents/.needs-customization` marker that `init.sh` drops only
on a genuinely fresh scaffold, deleted the moment it's asked either way.
See `templates/codex/skills/feature/SKILL.md.tmpl`'s Preflight step 1.

## Design decisions, and why

- **Zero dependency, bash + sed only — for the scaffolder itself.**
  `bin/init.sh` needs nothing beyond bash, sed, and diff: scaffolding has
  nothing to install or go stale. The *generated runtime scripts* have a
  small, standard footprint each one documents in its own header:
  `python3` and `curl` everywhere (`oc.sh`), GNU/coreutils `timeout` on
  macOS via `brew install coreutils` (`oc.sh`), and `tmux` if you use
  `scripts/team.sh`.
- **Project-specific constraints are never duplicated into the templates.**
Every generated agent file says "read this project's own `AGENTS.md`
first" rather than trying to guess or hardcode what a given
project cares about (security posture, banned patterns, style). The
toolkit owns the *process*; each project's own guidance file owns the
*content*.
- **The reviewer defaults to blanket-deny on edit/write.** A prior real run
found that a blanket "deny" configuration still let a reviewer write to a
file outside its intended scope — the enforcement didn't match the
config. `reviewer.md.tmpl` keeps the safe default and documents, inline,
exactly how to verify before loosening it (dispatch the agent, try to
make it edit a source file, confirm it's refused). Do not trust "the
reviewer can't touch source" without having run that check once against
your actual OpenCode server.
- **Session reuse (implement → review → test in one OpenCode session) is
documented as a real tradeoff, not a free win.** It saves reload cost but
feeds the reviewer the implementer's full read/edit trace, which can be
larger than the diff it's meant to review. Measure it before assuming
it's cheaper.
- **Each role's file is self-contained, one full copy per tool — not a
canonical file with thin per-tool shims.** `senior_dev` (Codex Terra) and
`builder` (OpenCode) do the identical job for two different vendors, and
yes, their prose is duplicated by hand. A shared-file-plus-shim version was
tried and reverted: it meant an extra file open before a role could do
anything, made "can this role load a skill" depend on plumbing that turned
out to differ unpredictably per tool, and added structure for a
generalization (N tools per role) that, in practice, only ever had two
tools and one duplicated role. Two full files you can read start to finish
beat one indirection layer for a toolkit this size. The real cost of
duplication — a fix needing N edits — is real, but it's a one-time,
occasional cost each time behavior actually changes, not a permanent
runtime cost every dispatch pays. See `docs/ADDING-A-TOOL.md` for the
recipe to follow **at the point a role genuinely needs a second or third
tool** — extract to a shared file then, not preemptively.



## The `delegate` skill

Independent of `init.sh` — it's about the **lead's** own context, not the
pipeline's shape. Load it (`/delegate` or however skills are invoked in
your setup) at the start of any session that's going to dispatch several
subagents or shell out to `scripts/oc.sh` repeatedly. It covers: when a
dispatch is worth its overhead, why raw event streams are the biggest
avoidable context cost, named anti-patterns (circular delegation, context
loss across a handoff, silent scope creep, retrying into a collision)
drawn from real pipeline incidents, and a
four-way rule for simple tasks — one-off simple work you just do yourself,
simple work that recurs becomes a script, judgment that recurs becomes a
Skill, and only genuinely one-off judgment or cross-vendor work becomes a
delegate dispatch. `verify-state.sh` and `promote-findings.sh` exist
because that rule was applied to this toolkit's own pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Task[A task shows up] --> Q1{Recurring?}
    Q1 -- no --> Q2{Needs judgment?}
    Q2 -- no --> Self[Do it yourself - one tool call]
    Q2 -- yes --> Deleg[Dispatch a delegate]
    Q1 -- yes --> Q3{Needs judgment?}
    Q3 -- no --> Script[Write a script under scripts/]
    Q3 -- yes --> Skill[Write it up as a Skill]
```

## The `status-board` skill

Also independent of `init.sh`. A per-task state file stays current on its
own — each role updates it as it works — but nothing rolls that up into a
project-wide "what's the state of everything" view unless something forces
it to happen every time, not just when a task finishes. This skill is that
rule: update the top-level status board (one row per active task: id,
title, live `Status:`, which longer-term checklist item it maps to) at the
end of every pipeline step, and only check off a longer-term checklist box
once a task's `Status:` actually reaches its terminal "done" value, not
when review merely passes or implementation merely finishes. `$feature`'s
step 5 points at it; load it explicitly for it to apply to every step, not
only the last one.

## Optional: the `self-improvement` skill (off by default)

Not loaded by anything in this toolkit automatically — the `$feature` skill
does not reference it the way it does `delegate` and `karpathy-guidelines`.
That's deliberate: it edits the **lead's own instructions** in response to
something you say mid-session, and self-modifying prompts are a real risk
category worth an explicit opt-in, not a default.

What it does: watches for you correcting the lead's *orchestration* (not a
role's code — that's the reviewer's job) or confirming an unusual approach
worked, and writes the durable version of that lesson into `$feature` or
the relevant role file — a sentence, not a rewrite — so a future run
doesn't need the same correction twice. It reuses *Findings for docs* +
`promote-findings.sh` for anything that's a project fact rather than a
pipeline-orchestration rule, instead of inventing a second memory
mechanism. Full behavior and guardrails: `skills/self-improvement/ SKILL.md`.

**To enable it in a project:**

1. Copy the file in:
  `cp -R /path/to/agent-toolkit/skills/self-improvement .agents/skills/self-improvement`
   (the repository skill location Codex discovers).
2. Add one line to that project's own `.agents/skills/feature/SKILL.md`, next
  to the existing `delegate`/`karpathy-guidelines` line: `If the  "self-improvement" skill is available, load it now.`
3. Read the guardrails in the skill file once before relying on it — it's
  scoped to be conservative (records constraints, never loosens them;
   asks rather than guesses; reports every edit it makes in the same
   turn), but it does write to your pipeline's own instruction files,
   which is a different risk than anything else in this toolkit.



## Adding a new tool, or moving a role to one

Not something `init.sh` does on its own for an untemplated tool — it's a
recipe, not a flag; `skills/toolkit-init/SKILL.md` branches to it when
asked for a tool with no `templates/<tool>/` directory yet. See
`[docs/ADDING-A-TOOL.md](docs/ADDING-A-TOOL.md)`: how to bring a role like
`tester` to a tool it doesn't run under yet, and — only once a role is
actually duplicated across 2+ tools, not before — how to collapse the
duplicated prose into one shared file so a future fix is one edit instead
of N. You can hand that file to an AI directly ("follow
docs/ADDING-A-TOOL.md to add `<tool>` support for `<role>`") and it has
enough to act on without re-deriving the pattern from scratch.

That recipe is for porting a *worker* role to a new tool. If you want a
*different AI to be the lead itself*, see `[SYSTEM.md](SYSTEM.md)` instead
— a single tool-agnostic file meant to be handed directly to that AI,
rather than something `init.sh` generates for it.

If most or all of the roles need a tool `init.sh` doesn't template — not
just one role under an otherwise Codex+OpenCode setup —
`skills/dev-team-generator/SKILL.md` runs this same research-then-write recipe as its default path
instead of an escape hatch, and does it self-contained (no dependency on
this repo's own `docs/`/`templates/`), so it also works handed to another
project on its own.

## Known gaps

- `test/smoke.sh` covers the scaffolder's core guarantees (placeholder
  substitution, never-clobber on re-run, `--update` diffing, the
  findings-path traversal guard, the loop-cap and budget checks, the
  refusal to mark a task `done` on an open acceptance criterion, and
  `verify-spec.sh`'s three cases), and `test/invariants.sh` covers rule
  presence across the hand-synced copies — but nothing yet runs a *live*
  pipeline end to end against a real OpenCode server. **Permission
  enforcement in particular still needs the manual verification described
  under "Design decisions", and remains the single biggest unverified
  assumption in this toolkit.**
- The checks are structural by design. They can tell you a spec is
  unfinished, a budget is blown, or a criterion was closed without
  evidence; they cannot tell you the spec is *wrong* or the evidence is
  *good*. That judgement is still the reviewer's, the tester's, and yours
  at the approval and merge gates.
- Nothing here validates that a given OpenCode `vendor/model` string is
  real — `opencode models` is the source of truth and isn't queried by
  `init.sh` automatically.

## Reviews and upgrading

- [`docs/UPGRADING.md`](docs/UPGRADING.md) — how an already-scaffolded
  project stays current with this toolkit: the provenance stamp, the
  impact-tagged `CHANGELOG.md`, `--update`'s triage mode, `migrations/`,
  and `$toolkit-update`. See "Updating a project" above for the commands;
  this file is the reasoning behind them.
- [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) / [`REVIEW-2.md`](REVIEW-2.md) — point-in-time
  honest reviews of this toolkit's own design, kept rather than deleted so
  the reasoning behind a fix (and what's still open) isn't lost once the
  fix lands.
